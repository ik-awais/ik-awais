## 👋 Hi, I’m Muhammad Awais

I’m a programmer focused on building **practical, problem-solving tools** through code. My primary interests lie in **computer vision, automation, and human–computer interaction**, where I work on creating intuitive and efficient solutions that bridge software with real-world interaction.

I enjoy turning ideas into working systems—especially those that involve gesture control, visual input, and automation workflows.
